Click [**here**](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1163917903435931659&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands) to add Matrixine to your server. Currently it requests Administrator, which isn't the best, but that will change as I further develop it.

What is Matrixine? After all it is a made up word I thought sounded cool. Matrixine started as a hobby project more than anything. Simply just "Hey, this sounded cool."

#### That was *four* years ago now.

Of course, this bot is too simple for four years of work; however, I have nevertheless continued working on iteration after iteration, and now the time has come. 

## Advantages of Matrixine
Currently, Matrixine is fast. Due to its small size, it has very little to handle, and has no issues blazing through requests. Matrixine lives on an Arch Linux server running a Ryzen 9 3900X, meaning nothing is holding it back but you! Matrixine is also actively developed! I work on it every so often to iron out issues or add features, meaning if you want to see something added, your word is powerful and you can mold, shape, and shift what Matrixine becomes! Matrixine is in your hands. 

## Matrixine's Mission

## Matrixine is still in Early Alpha
Expect bugs! Due to the hiccups I've had in the past, a lot of the code is dated and deprecated, which could cause some commands to fail unexpectedly! While Matrixine's output is monitored, I have a day job to attend to, and this is a single-man project, so unfortunately any critical errors will have to wait until I am available to fix them!

## A Little Bit of Lore
Matrixine was originally developed to be a simply music bot for "the boys"/"the group" while gaming or talking. Since I was the computer nerd, that burden fell onto me. Long story short, I realized I was kind of pretty ok at this thing, and so I began work on "a discord bot" quote unquote. I already had music functionality since that was Matrixine was originally built for. To be a steady, stable, and reliable source of audio streaming. Slowly, I added more and more. Generalizing the bot's use cases, expanding the powers it had. ... Then it was all deleted. Start work again, and then in Jan. of 2025, a catastrophic hard drive failure lost all the code for Matrixine another time. So I ported over the years old code from a previous iteration on a private repo. The original code worked, but it still has kinks in it. For example, discord's username change slightly warped all of the code that would work, and I know I can't catch all of it until it reers its ugly head. So that's why I've begun the process of publishing Matrixine.

## License Specifications

To cap things off, I would like to mention that Matrixine is **not** a template, but is instead a "Source Available" service. All of the code here shall always be for noncommercial use and shall properly acknowledge the code's original author: Me. For any further licensing questions, please refer to [__The License__](https://github.com/ZettaBite4031/Matrixine/blob/main/LICENSE.md)

"Can I use Matrixine privately?" The answer is sure. As long as I am acknowledged and no commercial use is made, I have no issues with the repo being cloned. Although, you gotta figure out how. I left you the `requirements.txt` and that should be enough. What I will mention, though, is that environment variables for config.py are loaded using dotenv. Good luck! ;P
