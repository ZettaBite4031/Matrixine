What is Matrixine? After all it is a made up word I thought sounded cool. Matrixine started as a hobby project more than anything. Simply just "Hey, this sounded cool."

#### That was *four* years ago now.

Of course, this bot is too simply for four years of work; however, I have nevertheless continued working on iteration after iteration, and now the time has come. 

## Matrixine's Mission
Matrixine was originally developed to be a simply music bot for "the boys"/"the group" while gaming or talking. Since I was the computer nerd, that burden fell onto me. Long story short, I realized I was kind of pretty ok at this thing, and so I began work on "a discord bot" quote unquote.
